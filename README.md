# Texas HoldEm Hands To Play
## Poker Strategizer App made by Mena Hassan
#### This app was made using Android Studio, java, XML, and CSS by Mena Hassan. To use the app, first, input your two starting cards (and whether they are the same suit or different suits) when playing Poker Texas Hold'Em. The app then tells you whether your cards are playable (whether you should play these cards) all the time, only in middle/late positions, only in late positions, or never.
