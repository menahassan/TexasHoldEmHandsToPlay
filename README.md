2. Click the "Should I Play" button to reveal the best strategy given your starting cards
The possible results are:
- Playable in all positions
- Only playable in middle/late positions
- Only playable in late positions
- Should never be played

(Note: "Positions" refer to the order in which the player is seated around a poker table. A player in a late position is the last or second the last player. Players who are seated in later positions have an advantage)
